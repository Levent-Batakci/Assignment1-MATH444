# Assignment1-MATH444
This repository contains all of the code, as well as the writeup, for my first MATH444 homework. This assignment deals primarily with visualization, PCA, and k-means.

#Author: Levent Batakci
All of the MATLAB code in this repository is my original work.
Furthermore, the LaTeX writeup is also my original work.
